  I am a communications and electronics engineer with more than ten years of experience in software development. Most of my experience is focused on web environments, however, I have also done native android applications, microcontrollers, cross-platform desktop clients and scripting projects. Currently, I have achieved the [Azure Fundamentals (AZ-900)](https://www.credly.com/badges/2a4ea5ef-e9fe-45a8-828d-7f3fe624e14e/public_url)and [Certified Kubernetes Application Developer](https://www.credly.com/badges/a2879a49-9640-4e23-bf6a-b5ddc9b5013c) certifications and my next objective it the [Green Software for Practitioners (LFC131)](https://learn.greensoftware.foundation/). 

  My interest is focused in open source solutions to problems of social relevance and organizational impact, as well as the automation of processes and improvement of services.

  I want to help to create a better world, not only for those who already have privilege and technology but also for those who are born, grow up and live in the most unfavorable conditions of the modern world.
