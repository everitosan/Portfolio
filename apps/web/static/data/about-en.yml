title: About me
content:
  - I am not satisfied with the inequality of the status quo, fake smiles, comfort and indifference. I am not satisfied with modernity. To be punk is to go against normality, accompanied by philosophy and desire to change the established. Question why we do, buy, want. Resist the everyday rutine and pop culture. Dying on the line with the most vivid morality. 
  - To be cyber is to leverage tools and technology for a non-dystopian future. It is learning and reinventing yourself every day with intelligence and courage. I don't identify with the interests of the market, or with the idea of perpetuating inequality, marginalization and wage disparity, or thinking that life is better without suffering. 
  - You can call me Evesan.
