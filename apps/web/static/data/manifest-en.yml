  # Manifest   
    
  I am not satisfied with the inequality of the status quo, the false smiles, the comfort and indifference. I am not comfortable with modernity.
  Being a punk is going against the norm, accompanied by philosophy and the desire to change the established. It is to question why we do, buy and desire, is to resist the everyday flow and pop. Being a punk is to die on the line with the most alive morality.

  It is harnessing the tools and technology for a non-dystopian future. It is learning and reinventing yourself every day with intelligence and courage. I do not identify with the idea of ​​the accumulation of capital without meaning, nor with the idea of ​​perpetuating inequality, the disparity of wages and marginalization, nor of thinking that life is better without suffering.

  You can call me idealistic...

  You can call me crazy and abnormal...

  You can call me Evesan.
